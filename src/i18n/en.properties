CMD_INFO=DESCRIPTION\n\
This Plugin is used to integrate a RisingWorld Server into a Discord Server.\n\
It will send 4 types of messages to Discord.\n\
1. Support messages sent by using the PH_CMD_SUPPORT command\n\
2. local chat messages\n\
3. Server Status events (plugin on/off, player dis-connected, files changed)\n\
4. (if enabled) Kills of mounts and non hostile animals as well as remove and \n\
   destroy of objects that can be picked up (workbench for example)
\n\
• If the Discord-Bot is configured in settings.properties an admin can send back\n\
support messages to one or all players.\n\
• You can configure the chat-channel name, so that you can write to local server chat from Discord.\n\
• If you type "+screen" (or "+s ") in a message, a screenshot will be sent to the Discord-Channel.\n\
• If you type "+screennogui" (or "+sng ") in a message, a screenshot without gui will be sent to the Discord-Channel.\n\
• If you type "+tp " in a message, your current coordinates will be send to chat and discord.\n\
\n\
Additionally there are some commands to help administration like server restart.\n\
